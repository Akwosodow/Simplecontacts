# Simplecontacts
A (currently) very shitty contact book that is worse than just  editing a CSV file yourself


## to use

Just run the app.py file and inspect the plethora of options avalible to you at the current moment (half don't work and none of them have error handling).

Realistically since the functions are already there one could easily edit the python file to make things work if I haven't updated it yet.

Additionally an example CSV file has been provided since adding contacts isn't implemented yet
